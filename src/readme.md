The "Smart Home Management System" project involves developing a smart home management system to apply students' knowledge of Java programming and object-oriented programming (OOP).
The project will include various classes, methods, enums, and other OOP concepts.
This system will enable users to manage different devices (such as lights, thermostats, cameras, and doorbells) within a smart home and perform related operations.
